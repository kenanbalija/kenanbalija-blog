I asked ai to write this intro, here it goes:

Hey there! I'm Kenan, a software engineer who spends most of my time building web appsâ€”but I'm on a mission to change that. This is my corner of the internet where I write about my coding journey, unfinished projects (we all have them), and the tech experiments I'm diving into. When I'm not coding, you'll find me training or gaming. Always open to trying new tech and connecting with fellow developers. Drop me a line at kenanbalija.dev@gmail.com if you want to chat!
