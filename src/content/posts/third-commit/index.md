# No brain Ghoul

So Past few months I've been using Cursor to do all my code editing. It goes like this:
First I feed it context files / lines. Then I tell it what to do. And then while it's running, i change screens, open google, some other stuff etc. and I lose focus. So it takes me a moment to get back to the flow, and I hated it. One thing I did to keep focus was doodling. It helped but I still felt like a no brain ghoul.

So I changed editor. I canceled my Subscription this week for Cursor, and I bought Zed Pro. It's cheaper but comes with a lot less tokens, so actually it is more expensive than Cursor. But on the other hand I spend more time thinking about code and prompts I don't mindlessly tell it what to do.


To be honest Zed is better editor even though it's not even released yet. I love it's simplicity.

I also installed LazyGit extension and running GUI with keyboard shortcuts feels really good.

Regarding the fitness app, I fixed some minor bug regarding login, added video to the exercises screen, and now it properly shows reps and rounds.

So that's it for now, I'm back, not a ghoul anymore.
