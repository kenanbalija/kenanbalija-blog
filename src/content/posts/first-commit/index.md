## Es-selamu Alejkum Dunya!

So first time writing anything. I am goint to try and not use ai for these posts. Hope you enjoy!

I always start apps, but i never seem to finish them. I think if I can reflect back on why I started them I can get back to working on them.

First up: mobile app, multiplatform. I decided to use react native. Tried building an app with an expo and it was super fast, had a working app in 15 minutes.

I wanted to build a hyrox fitness platform. But I think I can scale it better than everfit. So it begins.
