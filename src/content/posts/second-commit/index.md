## Expo is good!

I am using react expo. Development is really fast and it works immediatly for mobile and web. Seems like web has some issues, but I did not dwell too much into it.

Btw react native is not too far from standard react. I understand everything, almost.

Added login/register screens. Added theme's as well.

As I am writing this I am watching the Universal React Server Components in Expo Router by Evan Bacon. It's the react conf talk from last ('24) year. Seems like new stuff is really good and usefull for UI/UX.

I will dwell on it deeper in future.

That's it. This is my small update for now!


P.S.

Also seems like **Vercel CEO is genocide supporter**, I am thinking of moving this blog to another provider!


Cheers!
